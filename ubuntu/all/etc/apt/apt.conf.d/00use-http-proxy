# Purpose: Direct test systems at local Squid proxy server for cached updates

# FIXME: Direct access works, but APT completely fails to work without
# reachable proxy server specified below
#Acquire::http::Proxy "http://172.23.194.74:3128";

# Use workaround for LP bug 827627 to allow opportunistic proxy use
# (e.g., fall back to direct access if proxy unavailable)
Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect "/etc/apt/detect-http-proxy.sh";
